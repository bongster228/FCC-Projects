            <p>This section provides definitions for the specific terminology and the concepts used when describing the C++ programming language.
            A C++ program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source files) that contain declarations. They undergo translation to 
            become an executable program, which is executed when the C++ implementation calls its main function.
            Certain words in a C++ program have special meaning, and these are known as keywords. Others can be used as identifiers. Comments are
            ignored during translation. Certain characters in the program have to be represented with escape sequences.
            The entities of a C++ program are values, objects, references, structured bindings (since C++17), functions, enumerators, types,
            class members, templates, template specializations, namespaces, and parameter packs. Preprocessor macros are not C++ entities.
            Entities are introduced by declarations, which associate them with names and define their properties. The declarations that
            define all properties required to use an entity are definitions. A program must contain only one definition of any non-inline function
            or variable that is odr-used.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Preprocessor">
            <header><h1 class="section-header">Preprocessor</h1></header>
            <article>
                <p>The preprocessor is executed at translation phase 4, before the compilation. The result of preprocessing is a single file
                which is then passed to the actual compiler.</p>
                <h3>Directives</h3>
                <p>The preprocessing directives control the behavior of the preprocessor. Each directive occupies one line and ahs the folowing
                    format:
                    <ul>
                        <li># Character</li>
                        <li>Preprocessing instruction</li>
                        <li>Arguments</li>
                        <li>Line break</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Initialization">
            <header><h1 class="section-header">Initialization</h1></header>
            <article>
                <p>The initial value may be provided in the initializer section of a declarator or a new expression. It also takes plac
                during function calls: function parameters and the function return values are also initialized.
                For each declarator, the initializer may be one of the following:</p>
                <code>
                    (expression-list)   (1)
                    = expression        (2)
                    {initializer-list}      (3)
                </code>
                <h3>Non-Local Variables</h3>
                <p>All non-local variables with static storage duration are initialized as part of program startup, before the execution of
                the main function begins (unless deferred, see below). All variables with thread-local storage duration are initialized as
                part of thread launch, sequenced-before the execution of the thread function begins. For both of these classes of variables,
                initialization occurs in two distinct stages:</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header><h1 class="section-header">Functions</h1></header>
            <article>
                <p>A function declaration may appear in any scope, but a function definition may only appear in namespace scope or, for member
                and friend functions, in class scope. A function that is declared in a class body without a friend specifier is a class
                member function. Such functions have many additional properties, see member functions for details.
                Functions are not objects: there are no arrays of functions and functions cannot be passed by value or returned from other
                functions. Pointers and references to functions are allowed, and may be used where functions themselves cannot.</p>
                <code>
                        // function name: "isodd"
                        // parameter list has one parameter,
                        // with name "n" and type int
                        // the return type is bool
                        bool isodd(int n)
                        {                      // the body of the function begins
                            return n % 2;
                        }                      // the body of the function ends
                </code>
                <p>Each function has a type, which consists of the function's return type, the types of all parameters (after array-to-pointer
                and function-to-pointer transformations, see parameter list) , whether the function is noexcept or not (since C++17),
                and, for member functions, cv-qualification and ref-qualification. Function types also have language linkage.
                There are no cv-qualified function types (not to be confused with the types of cv-qualified functions such as
                int f() const; or functions returning cv-qualified types, such as std::string const f();)</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
            <header><h1 class="section-header">Statements</h1></header>
            <article>
                <p>Statements are fragments of the C++ program that are executed in sequence. The body of any function is a sequence
                of statements. For example:</p>
                <code>
                        int main()
                        {
                            int n = 1;                        // declaration statement
                            n = n + 1;                        // expression statement
                            std::cout << "n = " << n << '\n'; // expression statement
                            return 0;                         // return statement
                        }   
                </code>
            <p>C++ includes the following types of statements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Expression Statements</li>
                <li>Compound Statements</li>
                <li>Selection Statements</li>
                <li>Iteration Statements</li>
                <li>Jump Statements</li>
                <li>Declaration Statements</li>
                <li>Try Blocks</li>
                <li>Atomic and Syncrhonized Blocks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Compound Statements</h3>
            <code>
                    if (x > 5)          // start of if statement
                    {                   // start of block
                        int n = 1;      // declaration statement
                        std::cout << n; // expression statement
                    }                   // end of block, end of if statement
            </code>
            <code>
                    int main()
                    {
                        {                                // start of block
                            std::ofstream f("test.txt"); // declaration statement
                            f << "abc\n";                // expression statement
                        }                                // end of block: f is flushed and closed
                        std::ifstream f("test.txt"); 
                        std::string str;
                        f >> str; 
                    }
            </code>
            <h3>While Loop</h3>
            <code>
                    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
                            int main() {
                            // while loop with a single statement
                                int i = 0;
                                while (i < 10)
                                     i++;

                                int j = 2;
                                while (j < 9) {
                                    std::cout << j << ' ';
                                    j += 2;
                                }
                                std::cout << '\n';

                               char cstr[] = "Hello";
                               int k = 0;
