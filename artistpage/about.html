                Tim Bergling (Swedish: [tɪm ²bærjlɪŋ]; 8 September 1989 – 20 April 2018), known professionally
                as Avicii (/əˈviːtʃi/, Swedish: [ɑviʃi]), was a Swedish musician, DJ, remixer and record producer.[2]
                At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his
                first record deal.[3] He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio
                album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received
                generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped
                international dance charts;[4][5][6][7] the lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in
                Europe and reached number four in the United States.

                In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an
                EP, Avīci(01).[8] His catalogue also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero,
                "You Make Me", "X You", "Hey Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting forLove", 
                "Without You" and "Lonely Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his
                work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012[9]and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications
                credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music into Top 40radio in the early
                2010s.[10][11]
                Bergling retired from touring in 2016 due to health problems, having suffered stress and poor mental
                health for several years.[12] On 20 April 2018, Avicii committed suicide in Muscat, Oman. He was
                buried on 8 June in his hometown of Stockholm.
